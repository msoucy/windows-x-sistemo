Windows X-Sistemo
=================

Windows Keyboard Layout to support Esperanto X-system.

The S,C,G,H,J,U keys all act as dead keys.
Pressing x/X immediately after them will print Ŝ,Ĉ,Ĝ,Ĥ,Ĵ,Ŭ, respectively.
Otherwise it prints the letters typed.

In addition, ^ acts as a dead key leader.
Pressing any of the Esperanto accented letters after it will produce the appropriate character, otherwise it falls back to the characters typed.

Due to Windows being problematic, this keyboard registers itself as Yiddish, since that's a language that I don't use.
Windows doesn't support registering to the Esperanto locale, and the only tool to make them doesn't support the locales properly.
